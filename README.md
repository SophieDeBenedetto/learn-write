# Learn Write

`gem install learn_writer` then run `learn-write` from the command line in the directory of the project that needs meta data. This will create and write valid content to `.learn`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md` files. If `README.md` is already present, it will not overwrite content.
